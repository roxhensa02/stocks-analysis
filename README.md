# stocks-analysis

## Overview of the analysis
*Explain the purpose of this analysis.*

In this project we will analyze different types of stock and their behavior in 2017 and 2018. Eventhough, we were succesful analyzing the data through the module, in this project we will refactor the code. Refactoring the code will make it more efficient as will take few steps, using less memory and also easy to read in future for the users.

## Results: 
*Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.*

 As we expected, the results of the analysis are same as the one from module. Eventhough, most of the stocks had a high performance in 2017, through 2018 most of them had performed poorly. The only stocks that still had a good prformance though 2017 and 2018 are ENPH and RUN. Also, after refactoring the code the exectution time is faster compared with the code developed from the module.

## Summary: 

*In a summary statement, address the following questions.*

*1.What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?*
*2.How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?*

The advantages of refactoring the code is that the code is simpler to read and also for the future. It has the necessary comments to easly read. Also, is using less memory as it takes fewer steps. The excecution time is faster compared to the previous code. Therefore, it is always a good idea to revise the code and find ways to shorten it and writting it in a clear understandable way.
